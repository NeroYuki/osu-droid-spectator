/**
 * The base osu! module imports the core Node.js `path` module as `node:path`
 * to avoid conflicts with the `path` module from npm.
 *
 * For whatever reason, Browserify is not able recognize the `path` module as a core
 * Node.js module and instead tries to find it in the root folder of this project.
 *
 * As a result, this file is required as a workaround for Browserify to recognize
 * the `node:path` import as a core Node.js module.
 *
 * See {@link https://github.com/browserify/browserify/issues/1986 this} GitHub issue
 * for more information.
